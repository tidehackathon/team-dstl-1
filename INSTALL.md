# Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following from the top level directory. We are assuming you have Python 3 and PIP installed.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` should cover all the components, and enable to whole project to be run. Some additional dependencies may be required for some of the notebooks and workings.

## Proof of Concept

To run the Proof of Concept pipeline, see the [Proof of Concept README](proof_of_concept/README.md) for instructions. The sub-components also have individual `README.md` files in their respective folders.
