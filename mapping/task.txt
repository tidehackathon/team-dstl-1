######### UAV #########

came from front line - why were we right
EW causes UAV to lose all communication with drone (video, control, coms, gps links)
visual navigation without that!

UAV top down videos and telemtry logs, nothing front line there
GPS in log files
consider control, video, navigation

sample 8 only openable with vlc (shit?)

top down frames, rural? example frames looked rural

visual based navigation to any open sourced autopilot or emulate instructions to flight controller (harder there)

precision, versatiity, open source ideally but not required

UAV logviewer, PX4, unknown

7 teams on UAV - 5 go to second round

judged: (1-5), 3 is met task
    understood problem
        getting extra data is worth points, can it be used real time/ offline
    delivered innovation
        be creative
    viability
        can we get it to mvp point
    documentation - tidepedia and github and azure (we need a documentated exemption to that?)
        big stress on this on tidepedia
    demo
        no powerpoint
