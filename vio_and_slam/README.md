# Visual Inertial Odometry and Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping

Useful techniques to be aware of are VIO and SLAM. 

## VIO

Visual Inertial Odometry is the process of using the video feed and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data to predict the location of a platform. 

## SLAM

Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) is the term used to refer to this common problem in robotics. From our research we conclude that these techniques will have low performance in the outdoor drone task.
