# Orthorectification

Orthorectification is the process of transforming an image to correct for perspective shift. This allows for sequences of images to be compared and processed in a consistent manner. We believe orthorectification is required to use simple optical-flow and pattern matching algorithms to estimate position.

## Useful Resources

The following libraries are a good place to start for common orthorectification tasks:
