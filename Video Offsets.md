# Video Offsets

The sample videos do not start at the same point in time as the telemetry logs. Below is a list of offsets, which are the start time (as a Unix epoch time) of the videos to enable matching between the video and the telemetry.

| Sample | Video | Offset |
| ------------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| 4 | full_video.mp4 | 1547031606 |
